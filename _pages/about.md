## About me

I am a 4th-year PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Qing He](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0000964?language=en) at Machine Learning and Data Mining group, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS).

I received my B.S. of Statistics and a dual degree of CS from the [School of the Gifted Young, USTC](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2016.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on machine learning and applications. In particular, I am working on Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning, and their applications, e.g., recommender systems and online advertising.

_Rather than exploiting the knowledge, I prefer exploring intelligence._

## Academic visits, internships, and industry collaborations

* Ph.D. visitor at [Prof. Pingzhong Tang](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~kenshin/)'s group in [IIIS, Tsinghua University](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), since 2018.
* Research Intern at Ant Financial AI, 2019.
* Research collaboration with Ant Financial for designing anti-fraud mechanisms, 2019.
* Research collaboration with Tencent for new approaches in Tencent advertising systems, 2018-2019.
* Research collaboration with Alibaba for reinforcement mechanism design, 2018-2019.
