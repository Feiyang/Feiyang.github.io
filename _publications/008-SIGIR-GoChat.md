**Abstract:**
A chatbot that converses like a human should be goal-oriented (i.e., be purposeful in conversation), which is beyond language generation. 
However, existing dialogue systems often heavily rely on cumbersome hand-crafted rules or costly labelled datasets to reach the goals. 
In this paper, we propose **Goal-oriented Chatbots (GoChat)**, a framework for end-to-end training chatbots to maximize the long-term return from offline multi-turn dialogue datasets.
Our framework utilizes hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), where the high-level policy guides the conversation towards the final goal by determining some sub-goals, and the low-level policy fulfills the sub-goals by generating the corresponding utterance for response.
In our experiments on a real-world dialogue dataset for anti-fraud in financial, our approach outperforms previous methods on both the quality of response generation as well as the success rate of accomplishing the goal.
